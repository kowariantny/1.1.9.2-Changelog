V1.1.9.7 is expected to go into public testing posthaste.

As always, everything is subject to change and nothing is set in stone, until it is.

There’s going to be some emphasis on Retaliation builds this time around, but more is still to come! Crucible fans should definitely check out the AI changes as they really change the feel of combat in dense situations and make things feel less chaotic (in a good way).

V1.1.9.7
[Game]

    Updated monster behavior when unable to reach the player. Monsters will now reposition less frequently and are more likely to “wait” or “roam” until a valid attack route is found resulting in much less unpredictable movement.
    Human enemies with equipment no longer have baseline resists to compensate for fluctuations in resists from their gear.
    Reduced monster % Cold Resist by 3% on Ultimate difficulty and 2% on Elite difficulty
    Fixed an issue where monster pathing could become blocked by certain monster skills.
    Fixed an issue where converted Retaliation damage would incorrectly scale with Cunning and Spirit damage bonuses.
    Fixed an issue that caused skill modifiers from items to persist on duration buff skills (ex. Blood of Dreeg, Pneumatic Burst) even after the items were removed. The buffs now expire immediately upon swapping the equipment.
    Swapping equipment that modifies pet skills now disables their on-death attacks (ex. Hellhound, Rune of Hagarrad)
