[LIST]
[*]% Physical Resist has been rebalanced across the entire game. Physical Resist is now available in more restricted gear slots, and in smaller amounts. To compensate, monsters now deal less Physical damage. This change was made to narrow the gap between builds capable of stacking excessive amounts of % Physical Resist and those that struggled to get % Physical Resist in the first place.
[*]Most consumables are now organized into one of three categories: Elixirs, Oils, and Tinctures. These categories share cooldowns and you can only benefit from one Elixir, Oil and Tinctures at any given time. The Aether Cluster and Potion of Clarity are notable exceptions.
[*]Oil consumables have had their durations increased to 900s. Bonuses updated or redesigned accordingly.
