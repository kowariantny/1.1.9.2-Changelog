V1.1.9.2

[Crucible]

    Increased reward quality scaling on Gladiator difficulty, with a more substantial increase at higher waves.
    Reduced Max Number of Grava’Thul’s Void Pools that can exist at any one time in the Crucible
    Nemesis Bosses now have reduced Crowd Control resists in the Crucible to match most boss Crowd Control resist values, also affects a select few bosses that had similar resists (Ex. The Sentinel). This change will mostly impact builds reliant on Crowd Control to maximize damage.

[Shattered Realm]

    Nemesis Bosses now have reduced Crowd Control resists in the Shattered Realm to match most boss Crowd Control resist values, also affects a select few bosses that had similar resists (Ex. The Sentinel). This change will mostly impact builds reliant on Crowd Control to maximize damage.

[Tech]

    Fixed an issue where certain item skill modifiers for pets would not correctly update the tooltip if multiple copies of the same modifier were equipped. This was a display issue only.

[Animation]

    Updated Jump Attack animation speed for 1h-melee and 2h-melee to match the speed used when dual wielding. This animation is used in many WPS skills and granted weapon attacks from items and components, as well as Soldier’s Markovian’s Advantage, and should result in a roughly 34% improvement.

[Game]

    Increased drop rate of Ugdenbloom from Rotting Stumps and Ugdenbog Golems, for real this time. Previously change only affected Ashes of Malmouth and not Forgotten Gods.
    Various human enemies and bosses no longer having scaling Elemental Resistance. This previously only applied to the Crucible game mode but is now game-wide.
    Damage converted to Physical is now properly reduced by Armor. This fix also applies to Retaliation damage converted to Physical.
    Reduced Armor on high armor enemies (ex. Bosses/Nemesis) at levels 90+. This reduction starts out small and scales up to roughly 4.5% for the highest level enemies encountered.
    Fixed an issue where rarely some enemy-only items would unintentionally drop as white quality equipment.
