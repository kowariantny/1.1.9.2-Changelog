[*]Item tooltips now hide detailed information for Components, Augments, and Skills by default, and do not include those factors in tooltip comparisons. By holding ctrl, all of this information is restored and is then included in tooltip comparisons. This was done to dramatically reduce tooltip bloat as much of this information is not required the majority of the time.
[*]% Physical Resist has been rebalanced across the entire game. Physical Resist is now available in more restricted gear slots, and in smaller amounts. To compensate, monsters now deal less Physical damage. This change was made to narrow the gap between builds capable of stacking excessive amounts of % Physical Resist and those that struggled to get % Physical Resist in the first place.
[*]Most consumables are now organized into one of three categories: Elixirs, Oils, and Tinctures. These categories share cooldowns and you can only benefit from one Elixir, Oil and Tinctures at any given time. The Aether Cluster and Potion of Clarity are notable exceptions.
[*]Oil consumables have had their durations increased to 900s. Bonuses updated or redesigned accordingly.
