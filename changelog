V1.2.0.0

[Major New Features]

* You can now play the entirety of the game up to the level cap on the difficulty that’s enjoyable to you. To support this, level scaling has been updated on Normal and Elite difficulty. Many areas on Normal now scale up to level 100. Elite difficulty now scales up to level 100 in all areas. Loot quality and experience gains remain higher on higher difficulties.
* All loot tables have been overhauled with 30-60% less items dropping. To compensate, loot quality and iron bits drops have been significantly increased.
* All Bosses now have a 100% chance to drop their (non-legendary) Monster Infrequents.
* A new base Evasion skill has been added, bound to Spacebar by default. Pause now defaults to P and the Party window to K. Existing players will need to set a keybind or reset their keybinds in order to take advantage of this.
* Potions have been removed from the game. The character now has potion skills baseline and does not need to keep them in their inventory. Dedicated potion buttons have been added to the Quickbar.
* Toggled buff effects are now automatically toggled on and no longer need to be on the skill bar. (Note: if your character currently has two exclusive skills learned, the one with more points invested takes priority)
* You can now disable visuals for toggled buffs in the game options to improve visual clarity on your character and to show off all that gear.
* New visuals have been added to alert you to Legendary, Monster Infrequent, Double Rare and Double Rare Monster Infrequent drops. Monster Infrequents are now marked by an icon to separate them from standard Rare items.
* Monster Health Bar options have been improved. You can now toggle thicker health bars and display % values for monster health.
* Monster Health Bar can now be toggled to also display all debuffs applied to the target monster.
* The Nullification mechanic (ex. Arcane heroes) has been overhauled. It now purges all temporary buffs and Disables toggled buffs for 5 seconds. No more fumbling through your skill bars to turn auras back on.
* New Accessibility Feature: Disable Day-Night Cycle. By enabling this, the game will be perpetually set to noon.
* New Accessibility Feature: Disable Fog. If you do not wish to see the ambient fog, you can disable it in the video options.
* New Accessibility Feature: Cooldown Counters. Enable this to see a numeric countdown on your skills on the quickbar.
* New Accessibility Feature: Auto-Pick Up Radius can now be increased or reduced from its default setting.

[Shattered Realm]

* A new Eternal Waystone has been added that can take you up to Shard 90 with rewards. Existing Deathly Waystones and blueprint have been converted to this waystone. A new Deathly Waystone is available upon beating Shard 95 or higher, but any previously unlocked shards are retained.
* Shrines have been redesigned with powerful new, but temporary blessings, all of which boost your Maximum Movement Speed for their duration. These blessings no longer carry any penalties. Shrine offerings have been updated.
* Increased drop chance of Shattered Souls from champion enemies.
* Increased monster % Crit damage by 5% on Ultimate difficulty.
* Increased monster Health scaling on Normal and Elite difficulties, particularly at shards 60+.
* The “A Done Deal” achievement now requires you to interact with each of the Shattered Realm’s shrines at least once, rather than having all 5 effects active at the same time.
* The Bonebleach special map has been disabled. It may return in the future after some much needed maintenance.

[Back to Table of Contents](#TOC)

[Crucible]

* Waves 150-170 now have 6 mutators as a positive player mutator is now always rolled for the 5th mutator.
* Increased monster % Crit damage by 5% on Gladiator difficulty
* Reduced Tribute penalty for failing the event, particularly if failing after using a checkpoint.
* The Tribute cap has been increased to 150.
* Spawn areas no longer grant a movement speed buff to monsters.
* Nullification has been re-enabled in the Crucible, at a reduced duration. Loxmere Nightmage’s nullification remains disabled as it is an instant effect that cannot be dodged.

[Back to Table of Contents](#TOC)

[Modding]

* The world map size limit has been increased from 2gb to 4gb. This should dramatically increase the size of mod maps you can create, but be aware that Crate will be using up some of that new space if you plan on modding the campaign map.
* The console now logs lua errors in custom games.
* Faction Slots have been expanded to 40. Note that Crate will be using these up through 18 in the near future, who can say beyond that. So plan accordingly!
* Localization has been integrated into the game data. You can alter localizations within your mods by overwriting and updating those files.

[Back to Table of Contents](#TOC)

[Art]

* Rock textures have been modernized across the game, particularly in the base game regions.

[Back to Table of Contents](#TOC)

[Game]

* A new monster mechanic has been added: Sundered. Many bosses can now Sunder your defenses, causing you to take X% additional damage for Y seconds. Multiple instances of Sundered do not stack, only the strongest effect is active.
* All mutators no longer have negative effects. Many mutators have been redesigned. Monster mutators that granted resistances no longer do so. Positive player mutators are now always rolled for the 2nd and 5th mutators.
* Challenge areas have had their loot quality and difficulty increased.
* Reduced the minimum chance to hit to 55%, from 60%, this is an indirect buff to Defensive Ability stacking.
* Hero Monster Archetypes (ex. Burning/Swift/etc) have had their special abilities updated/buffed. The most dangerous hero archetypes now have more prominent visuals to distinguish their presence.
* Bounty Hero monsters that use a Hero Archetype now correctly include their archetype in their name.
* Many vanilla Grim Dawn monsters have received a bump to their various abilities to bring them up to speed to modern standards.
* Reduced Monster Physical damage on Ultimate difficulty.
* Monsters abilities no longer apply % Resist Reduction and flat Resist Reduction. Unique monster debuffs that reduced resists continue to do so.
* Many monster special attacks have had their animation speeds reduced.
* Monsters with charge abilities are now significantly slower when charging.
* Increased Monster % Life Leech Resist. This makes % Attack damage Converted to Health less effective. On Ultimate difficulty, this is roughly a 30% reduction against an average boss. Defensive/healing abilities and Devotions have received a buff to compensate for this change.
* % Damage Reduction debuff effect no longer reduces the intensity of other debuffs (ex. reducing how much % Slow a monster’s attack applies). This was already the case for the new Sunder mechanic and is now consistent for older debuffs.
* Wendigo-type monsters have had their zoomies reined in and no longer approach you at the speed of sound.
* Monster health now scales more appropriately in Multiplayer. Mutators that affect monster health are now more clear as to how much % Health they provide.
* Removed Defense against pets from Celestial bosses and reduced their damage bonus against them.
* Tripled the rate of infamy gain with the Outcast faction when choosing to be hostile.
* Doubled the rate of fame/infamy gained with Kymon’s Chosen and the Order of Death’s Vigil.
* Pets now default to an Aggressive stance rather than the Normal stance. This setting can still be toggled on a pet by pet basis as desired.

[Back to Table of Contents](#TOC)

[Itemization]

* % Resistance Magic Prefixes that offer 2 of the 3 % Elemental Resistances (ex. Fire + Cold) have been removed from the loot pool at level 70+. Increased the chance of rolling % Elemental Resistance to compensate.
* % Resistance Magic Prefixes that offer % Pierce or % Poison with a combination of 1 % Elemental Resist (ex. Pierce + Cold) have been removed from the loot pool at level 70+. Increased the chance of rolling the % Pierce + % Poison Resistance pair to compensate.
